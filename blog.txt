so I want graphs and AI on my financial data
I want my financial AI to 
- know how much I typically spend and how much I typically earn.
- let me know where I am on the financial balance curve
- notify me of any irregularities or problems
- ensure that I review my transactions on a regular basis

and I DON'T WANT to type in transactions

there are lots of services that will scrape your bank details for you
IF YOU GIVE THEM YOUR INTERNET BANKING LOGIN

hmmmmm

Enter bankscrapechrome.

A chrome extension that will drive the process of scraping your bank from a currently active browser session.
Seeing as how we're using the current browser, we can login first.

Not a complete solution to automation (although in most cases login can be scripted too) but sufficient to make it a one input operation to import data from a given bank into your application.

Using javascript to engage with the DOM of the bank site within a current browser session, the scrape is indistinguishable from a real person clicking through the pages.
